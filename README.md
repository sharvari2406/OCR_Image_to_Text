# OCR_Image_to_Text
Made a simple OCR Image to text conversion project which converts the text written in an image to plain text. Before, executing the .py file make sure you complete the following two things :
1. Download Tesseract OCR from the link : https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki for your system (32-bit or 64-bit)
2. Install pip install tesseract 
You can try this out with different images.
